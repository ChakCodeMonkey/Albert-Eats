Hello, I'm working on a project called Albert Eats, which is a front-end clone of Uber Eats. The goal of this project is to recreate the user interface and experience of Uber Eats, allowing users to browse through food options, view details, and place orders.

----------

Features

- Interactive Cards and Hearts: Users can click on the cards to view more details about the food items, and they can also click on the hearts to save their favorite items.
- CSS Loader: Implemented a CSS loader animation to provide feedback to users while the site is loading.
- HTML and SCSS: The project is built using HTML for structure and SCSS for styling, following the 7-1 pattern for organizing SCSS files.
- Fun Project Names: I've incorporated fun and quirky names for the project and restaurant designs to add a playful touch to the user experience.
- Restaurant Designs: I've also created unique designs for the restaurants' logos to enhance the visual appeal of the site.
- Future Enhancements: In the future, I plan to incorporate JavaScript to add more interactivity to the site. For example, I may add a language selection system to support multiple languages and enhance the overall user experience.
